# React + Vite project

This project is built with React and Vite.

It's a simple project about a guitar store where guitars can be added to the shopping cart. You can add up to 5 items per guitar, with a minimum of 1. The price adjusts based on the quantity, and there are buttons to remove an item or empty the cart.
